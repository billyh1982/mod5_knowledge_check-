Create a New Webpage Using Bootstrap:
Set up a basic HTML file with the Bootstrap CDN linked in the <head> section.
Use a container or container-fluid to structure your layout.

Part 1: Form Creation and Layout
Build a Registration Form using Bootstrapâ€™s form components:
Include fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and a checkbox for agreeing to terms.
Use Bootstrapâ€™s grid layout to position the First Name and Last Name fields side-by-side.
Apply validation classes to ensure the Email and Password fields are required.
Add a Submit button styled with btn-success.

Part 2: Table for Displaying Data
Simulate Data Collection:
Below the form, create a table using Bootstrapâ€™s table component.
Hard-code user data into the table to simulate submissions.
Add striped and hoverable rows for better readability.
Make the table responsive by wrapping it in a table-responsive div.

Part 3: Image and Button Utilities
Add an Image Section:
Include a responsive image using the img-fluid class.
Place the image inside a fluid container to stretch it across the page.
Add a circular image (rounded-circle) below the main image.
Create Two Buttons with Utility Classes:
One button should be visible on all screen sizes.
The second button should be hidden on small screens using responsive display utilities (d-none and d-md-block).

Part 4: Navigation Bar
Build a Responsive Navigation Bar:
Create a navbar with links to Home, About, and Contact sections.
Ensure the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
Use Bootstrap utilities and components to style the navbar.
